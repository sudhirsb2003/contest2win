Installion instructions for the Ruby API with a workaround for Mac, contributed by Eric Hansen
November 13th, 2006
==================================================================

 1. Download the C API from http://www.maxmind.com/download/geoip/api/c/
 2. Do the following to build and install GeoIP:
{{{
./configure
make
make check
make install
}}}
 3. Download the ruby API from http://www.maxmind.com/download/geoip/api/ruby/
 4. Do the following to build and install GeoIP ruby: 
{{{
        ruby extconf.rb ruby extconf.rb --with-geoip-include=/usr/local/include
        make
        make install
}}}
 5. Test:
{{{
        rubytest
}}}

'''Important Note:''' there are a couple off issues with the download that prevent the ruby API from working on the mac.  The problem is that the mac is case-sensitive, but does not distinguish between files with the same name but different case.  You need to do the following: 
 1. When you untar GeoIP ruby, rename the file geoip.h to geoiplocal.h
 2. Modify the file geoip.c to change
{{{
#include "geoip.h"
}}}
to this:
{{{
#include "geoiplocal.h"
}}}
 3. Modify the file extconf.rb.
 3.1. Comment out the lines:
{{{
unless have_library('iconv','iconv_open') or
    have_library('c','iconv_open') or
    have_library('recode','iconv_open')
  crash(<<EOL) 
need libiconv.

        Install libiconv or try passing some of the following options
        to extconf.rb:

        --with-iconv-dir=/path/to/iconv
        --with-iconv-lib=/path/to/iconv/lib
        --with-iconv-include=/path/to/iconv/include 
EOL
end
}}}
 3.2. Change the following line:
{{{
$CFLAGS = '-g -Wall' + $CFLAGS
}}}
adding a space after -Wall to look like:
{{{
$CFLAGS = '-g -Wall ' + $CFLAGS
}}}

You may also need to build using:
#ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386" ruby extconf.rb
